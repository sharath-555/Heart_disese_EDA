# Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between various features and the target variable (heart disease presence). The analysis includes data cleaning, data type conversion, statistical analysis, and a variety of visualizations to interpret the dataset effectively.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is heart.csv, which contains various medical attributes related to heart disease diagnosis. Each row represents a patient, and each column represents a feature, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.

# Data Preparation
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
Data Inspection: The dataset is inspected for its shape, column names, data types, and unique values in each column.
Data Cleaning: Categorical variables are converted to the object data type, and missing values are checked.
Labeling: Some categorical features are relabeled for better interpretation and visualization.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis
Basic Statistics: Summary statistics are computed for numerical columns.
Distribution Plots: Bar plots are used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables like sex, chest pain type (cp), thal, and more.
Age Analysis: Age distribution is analyzed with bar plots, and the youngest, oldest, and average ages are identified.

# Bivariate Analysis
Count Plots: Count plots are created to examine the distribution of the target variable (heart disease) across different categories such as sex, chest pain type, and thalassemia.
Pie Charts: Pie charts are used to visualize the proportion of different thalassemia types among patients with and without heart disease.
Pair Plots: Pair plots are generated to explore relationships between continuous variables (e.g., age, cholesterol, maximum heart rate) and the target variable.
Linear Models: lmplot is used to understand the relationship between age and cholesterol levels, segmented by sex and heart disease status.

# Multivariate Analysis
Heatmap: A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between numerical features, helping to identify any strong relationships between variables.
Boxplots: Boxplots are used to detect outliers in numerical variables across different features.

# Outlier Detection
Outliers are visualized using boxplots for all numeric features. A summary boxplot is also created to give a comprehensive view of the distribution of values in the dataset.
